# Introduction to Nix (Flakes)

This set of docs illustrates some basic usage of nix, using flakes,
which provide an (experimental/non-stable .. but pretty stable)
alternative workflow and tooling.

- [Hello](./hello) dips in to initial usage using a docker container as a playground.
- [Rust, Grapql, Nix, Docker](./rs-gql) explores setting up a
  development and build environment for a web service.
